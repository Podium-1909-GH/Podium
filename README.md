## How does Podium work?

When you start recording the Web Speech API transcribes your speech. That transcription is processed on our server using a custom algorithm to find all the filler words in your speech. Sentiment analysis is also run on the transcription using the npm sentiment package. Once all the processing is complete the speech and its associated data are sent back to your browser and so you can see the speech's stats.
